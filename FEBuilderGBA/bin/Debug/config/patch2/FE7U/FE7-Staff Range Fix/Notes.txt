FE7-Staff/Range Fix
By Tequila

To create a new staff (or item), there're 4 tables you need to modify. 3 from vanilla, 1 from here: Usability, Target, and Effect. They affect items 0x4A (Heal) to 0x9A (60-Use Vulnerary, and end of the item list) Before the table, 0x4A is subtracted from the item id, and the compared to 0x50; if less than or equal, proceed, otherwise, use the default option. Any new item requires you to a) repoint and expand these, and b) increase the 0x50 number.

26D10	Usability	Determines whether you can use the item (default: no)
27128	Target		Determines who the item affects (default: self?)
2D04C	Effect		Determines what the item actually does (default: unknown, presumably nothing)

The staff range values are found after the usability table, and the target table actually branches into the same routine after a certain point. They all looked quite similar, although sometimes certain functions were called in a different order (for no good reason, I might add)

Heal/Mend/Recover:
Beginning at the jump table
ldr r1,2458D
b 26F22
mov char data to r0
bl 272D0
	bl (bx r1)
		2458C:
		store char data pointer at 2033E40 
		ldr r0,[202E3E8] (=3000C00, according to hextator's doc this is "Row pointers for move remaining map", but I think it's squares to highlight/can affect targets within)
		mov r1,0
		bl 190AC
			ldr r0,202E3D8 (has map size) (NOTE: These are 1-aligned, not 0-aligned)
			load height in r1 and add 4
			load length in r0 and add 2
			multiply them
			check if result is odd; if true, subtract 1
			and the param passed in r1 (currently 0) with 0xFF, lsl 8, add that to the original number, store on stack for safekeeping
			subtract 8 from 3000C00 and load what's there into r1 (3000C38) (end of row pointers, I think)
			divide area by 2 (I think; it does lsl 1F, add original to that number, lsl 0A, lsr 0B)
			orr that with 1000000
			bl BFA10
				This is CPUSet
				In this case, it zero'd out 0x98 words of the map...don't exactly know why. EDIT: It zeroes out halfwords, which is why it divides by 2 instead of 4.
			mov 3000C00 back to r0
			bl 1B190
				store r0 at 30041E0
		mov x coord to r0, y coord to r1, ldr r2,24539
		bl 23A74
			save that stuff to r4-r6
			bl 4ACE4
				store x coord as halfword at 203DCF4 and y coord afterwards
				store 0 (as a word) at 203DFF8
			r0=x coord, r1=y coord, r2=max, r3=1
			bl 1A2D4
				fill in 3000C00 again with squares that can be accessed with this particular staff
			r0=x coord, r1=y coord, r2=min, r3=-1
			bl 1A2D4
				Remove squares that can't be reached (basically, it adds 1 to all squares that are within radius (max) Then it subtracts 1 from all that squares are inside (out of range of) radius (min) Repeat as needed. Normally, the repeat wouldn't be necessary, since vanilla staves all have 1 as the minimum range.
			mov r0,r6 (has 24539, which will be bx'd to at some point)
			bl 239B0
				12900 cycles here, long function
				mov r0,7
				I think this checks all the squares that can be accessed, then checks if there's someone there by looking at a map pointed to by 202E3DC
				Puts allegiance byte in r0
				bl 18D0C
					Given allegiance byte, goes to table at B92EB0 and returns char data pointer there
				bl(bx r7) (This seems to do different checks depending on staff, like check if target is afflicted with a status, isn't at full health, etc)
					HEAL:
					checks the if the person being checked and the staff's user are of the same allegiance, returns true or false
					if true, checks if the user is being rescued
					if false, moves char data to r0
					bl 18A70
						returns current hp
					bl 18AB0
						returns max hp
					r0=target x coord, r1=target y coord, r2=target allegiance byte, r3=0
					bl 4ACFC
						ldr r8=203DCF8
						ldr r6=203DFF8
						ldr r5,[r6] (nothing, because we zero'd it out earlier at 4ACE4)
						multiply this number by 0xC and add r8 to this
						store target x coord at this location, y coord 1 byte afterwards, allegiance byte after that, and whatever r3 is after that
						add 1 to value at r6 and store it back there (maybe a queue?)
					NOTE:
					Heal checks if current hp < max hp
					Restore checks if status nibble is nonzero
					Barrier checks if torch nibble is greater than 6
					Warp has no extra checks
					Hammerne checks if there's a weapon with less than max uses
					return
				return
			return
		return
	bl 4B174
		load word at 203DFF8
	if non-zero, mov 1 to r0
lsl and asr r0 by 18, as usual
return

Highlighting squares:
When selecting a character:
Check if each weapon can be equipped
	if yes, get range byte and turn that into a halfword-length bitfield (2-3 range would be 0000 0000 0000 0110)
orr the bitfields
iterate through each square on the map, beginning at the bottom right corner
check if square can be moved to (compare to movement map)
	if yes, check if square has someone occupying it (compare to allegiance map)
		if no, compare to an unknown map
			if value at that tile = 0, write range
check if ballista ability is set
	if yes, iterate through each square again, same deal, except look for a ballista 
		if yes, write ballista's range

write range:
the function at 1A2D4 takes 4 parameters: r0=x coord, r1=y coord, r2=radius, r3=+/-1
for each square on the range map that is within (r2) distance of (r0,r1), add r3 to the value there (-1 is for squares less than the min, since it fills all squares from (max) inwards)
if the value is != 0, then that square can be targeted.

When selecting the attack option, the function to display squares is similar to above, minus the ballista check (and iterating through each square, since we already moved)

When selecting the weapon to use, only that weapon's range is displayed.
