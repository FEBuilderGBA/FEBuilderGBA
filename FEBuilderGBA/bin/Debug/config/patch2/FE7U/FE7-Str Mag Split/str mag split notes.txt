Str/Mag split notes

Hacks I can reference:
FE IV 
Midnight Sun 
FE: SS (?? Ask CC)

Things that need to be done:
Add byte in char data in ram
Add byte in char data in rom
Add byte in class data
Add stat cap in class data
Add growth in class data

Mag getter:
	Gets mag (duh)
	
Stat screen:
	Shift down stat names
	Shift down stat numbers/bars
	Shift down rescue penalty arrows
	Add in Mag name and information
	Prevent B/W/L from displaying
	Modify R-button infoboxes
	Change background so res doesn't hang off the bottom

Level-up screen:
	Make a new line on the background
	Lift title bar
	Move stat names and numbers to their new lines
	Make sure both versions (1 with anim, 1 without) are working

Weapon stat bonuses/stat boosters
	Done? Check how venno's passive stats boost thing works

Autolevelling

Promotion screen:
	See growths with animations
	
Prep screen:
	Done

Fighting Skill screen on Unit Menu: 
	Move skill names over
	Replace affinity with mag
	Done

Battle calculations:
	mag/2 distance
	mag/2 staff accuracy
	staff heal amt
	Done

IDEA:
Store magic stat in byte 0x39 of char data in ram
Rom Class base: 0xA
Rom Class cap: 0xB
Rom Class growth: 0x53
Rom Class promotion bonus: 0x54
Rom Character base: 0x23
Rom Character growth: 0x24
NOPE. Scratch all of these except first; make separate tables for them.

MS:
Set break on read to Faratrass' mag
break at 8719C; r0=ram class data, r1=rom char data, r2=(I assume) class cap (0x14), r3=mag from ram
write here upon restarting chapter at A628A

Str=10F8; text table is at B808AC; pointed to at 12cb8
Skill=10FB

bl to 7FD28 takes: r0=?, r1=x tile, r2=y tile, for stats/bar. Stack has current stat and stat cap
7FE10:
load 200310C,#0xC (char data)
bl 184DC (check if it should display Str (0)or Mag (1))
if Mag:
ldr r0,10F9
bl 12C60 (copy text from rom to ram)

FOR MAG TITLE: (suspicion: write all titles at once?)
ldr r0, 10F9
bl 12C60
mov r2,0
str r2,sp
str r0,sp+4
mov r0,r5
add r0,30
ldr r1,20032FE
mov r2,3 (Palette)
mov r3,0 (x placement)
bl 5AD4

For the stat:
load char data in r0
bl str getter (includes weapon bonuses)
load str from ram char struct into r3)
store str+bonus on sp
store cap at sp+4
mov r0,0
mov r1,5 (x placement of stat number and bar)
mov r2,1 (y placement of stat number and bar; this needs changing)
(r3 still has ram struct str)
bl 7FD28

TO PREVENT B/W/L from showing up, write E0 to 7FC13

5Ad4 is somehow relevant to where stat name gets written
skl-res are written before str/mag


Mag Class Table: indexed by class ID
Mag Promotion Bonuse Table: indexed by class ID

Promotions
####
Routine begins at 68B28
Store level at 2020108
Store max hp at 202010C, str +2, skl +4, luk+8, spd+6, def +A, res +C, class+char con +E (values from attacker data in battle struct, 203A470)
Store 1 at 202010A (new level, probably)
202011C: load stuff from 203A3F0 (seems new stats were written here) and write them here in the same order
bl somewhere; seems to copy bg to vram or something
r7 seems to be counter for stats
if mag, ldr r1=BDB5DC, if str, ldr r1=BDB5BC (has char ids)
ldr r0=2017660, lsl r7,3, add them together in r4, mov to r0, mov r1,3, bl 5474
Table at 2E5BF0 dictates placement of stat/number/level-up
get the correct entry, multiply by 2, add to 2023C60 (i think this is place in ram where one of the bg layers is located until it gets copied to vram)
stick that in r1, mov r0,r4, bl 5590 (probably does the heavy display lifting)
cmp r1,7, and loop if <=
162 16A
1A2 1AA
1E2 1EA
222 22A
262 26A
stuff at 202011C loaded around 697BA 
Another pointer to that table with placements for stats at 69840
68DDE mov r4,7
68DE2 ldrb
68EE2: nop
68EE6: ldrh->ldrb
697B0: nop
697B8 ldrb
697BA: ldrb
697C6: change strh to strb
69820: nop
69824: ldrh/strh
(which brings its own host of problems; this gets stored at 203E0BC) (ok, not actually an issue, just strh as usual)
69860: change 8 to A eventually

69388 has mov r2,0xBC; this is x position of portrait on promo screen
after drawing portrait (I assume), zero out 200 halfwords at 2023C60 (stuff there gets copied to 6005000 which is bg2)

suspected TSA at 1DB568 (nope, seems to be palette)
692BE: load 81DAFEC which is img 199 in r0, 2017784 in r1, bl to LZ77 decompress 8 bit (seems to be image)

img 202 is the outside part of the title box (where class name is written): loaded at 69314, but offset is -0x20; there's a palette in front, called with cpufastset, then the image is processed at 105C (nop'ing this out doesn't seem to do anything though)
Suspect img 203 is the filler inside the box (not true, it seems) (update: it's the box that comes afterwards showing which weapons you can now use)

69D2E: mov r2,20 (how long each row is) and mov r2,14 (how many rows to display) (maybe not?) Will need to change these.

69354: Change pointer to 2023560 (determines where the pic starts)

Figure out how that bloody flipping works:
Supposedly 4000020-4000026 has flipping (on second thought this is probably stupid, since this flips the whole thing?)
4000020 gets copied to from 30028B8
Unsurprisingly, setting a break here did nothing

69DFE and 69E04? YES! Nop'ing out the store here prevents the flipping. Well, around here, at least.
3002870 ? (doesn't change; modifying this number does shift the entire bg up/down)
sets 16 and 1A which are bg1 and bg2...

69DE2:
load halfword at 4000004 (Display Status)
check if first bit is set and skip this function if true (VBlank)
ldr r3,400001A (400001Ah - BG2VOFS - BG2 Y-Offset (W), whatever that means)
ldr r4,3002870 (stuff here doesn't seem to change during the flip) (changing this shifts the respective layer up and down, as expected)
ldr r2,201FB28
ldr r0,[r2] (=201FBE2)
ldrh r5,[r4,26] (=8)
ldrh r6,[r0] (=0)
add r1,r5,r6
strh r1,[r3]
add r0,2
str r0,[r2]
sub r3,4 (4000016h - BG1VOFS - BG1 Y-Offset (W))
ldr r2,201FDB4
ldr r0,[r2] (=201FE6E)
ldrh r4,[r4,22] (=8)
ldrh r5,[r0] (=0)
add r1,r4,r5
strh r1,[r3]
add r0,2
str r0,[r2]

69da0: 

Beginning 201FB7C is a series of halfwords that seem to describe zooming , goes until 201FC6C (height?)
Loaded from 202012C
Another set afterwards

69BEE loads FFE0 and stores that in this area; 


first begins with r1=FFE8 written to 1A (bg 2, height)
FFE8 8 9 E8FF 8 E8FF 6-C 8 4-6 9-14 E8FF
FFE0 written to 201FCBC first
this is loaded from 202012C
691CC = mov r1,90...possibility?
13008 has a jump table
696b2 might be relevant? Is called for the re-expanding part; goes from 1000 - 0. Definitely some kind of expanding coefficient because changing the number to 0 makes it appear instantaneously.
6962A seems to go from 0 - 1000, so it's the start to this whole collapsing business
Values: 0,40, 100, 240, 400, 640, 900, C40, 1000 are written to 202012C
These values are multipled by signed halfword entries starting at bdb6ec, do some shifting, and store result at 201FCBC and 201FF48? (not sure about the second, might not always be the same)

one of the bgs starts in wram at 200323C, other at 2003C3C

Fixing the part of the bg that doesn't zoom out in sync with the rest:
coords are written as words most of the time, at 11EE (function begins at 11B0)
However, 69DB0 maybe

691CC? seems not
69500 has height for portrait
4000014 written from 3002890 and 4000018 written from 3002894, and initially they're at 0x8 for the y positioning...but changing these in memory after they were written to the 3000 blah shifts the oam stuff upwards. What gives? EDIT: I derped. It shifts the bg downwards. Good. Except the scrolling is still messed up.

##################
Unit menu organizing thing

Set break when r0=10FA (S/M) text, broke at 8AC50, begins at 8ABC4, called at 8A744
Text seems to begin at CC3618, with 0x10 length entries: 7-D (position, probably) (word), text id (word), number (word), another number (position of r button?)
hector data at 202beb8
61E4 seems to be responsible. Takes r0=some ram ptr, r1=r6=palette number, r2=stat. r0 probably has to do with where things end up
200CBF0 has a pointer table of 0xC entries. Changes when rearranging the order. Row pointers?
First word is char pointer, so this seems likely

###############
Growths
Animations on:
295E0 checks whether stat increments and returns amt, i guess
once written to battle struct+73-79, go to 29970; this checks if those growths would put any stats above their caps

Animations off:
hp growth loaded at 74258, fn begins at 74d88
level up with animations ptr is 692A5, in 20254E8+0xC
68FE5
00000
69051
BDB61C + 4has this ptr
in anim-off, fn where tsa is loaded begins at 74008, called at 74A4A, begins 74A28

#############
Prep screen
Stats are loaded from ram, added to the bonus from the stat booster (what happens if more than 1?) and stored at 3004440. Function begins at 27578. Only loads character con and mov bonus, not the actual stat. After storing, calls 17C64, which (I believe) ensures none of the stats goes higher than allowed.
This is part of the usability check, looks like.
Displaying function seems to begin at 94D74. 61E4 seems to be the function that displays the numbers; r0=ram offset (probably where to draw), r1=palette id, r2=stat number.
r0 gets 80 added to it for each stat
94BD4 begins another function. r0=stat*24, r1=stat cap, bl to BFC88 (draws bars?) returns a number which gets put on stack.
R-button text (in this case, "Increases skill") called at 94F5C. Function begins at 94EF4; params are r0=char data in ram, r1=slot id
Write stats text function begins at 94A20
Possibility: Change 7 at 94A2E to 9.
615C seems to be responsible for displaying stat number
94CD8: Might have to change E0 to...FC? to display extra bars
94D5a: Change 7 to 9 also for bars?

HP starts at sp+0xC
Mag goes at sp+0x14


bg 2 begins at 2023C60 and is written to 600F000-6000F7FE
Originally, "Stat increased!" and item icon begin at 600F3A2-3F4
so in ram, it should begin at 2024002
