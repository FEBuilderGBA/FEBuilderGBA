	@ Okay. Now I need to check whether the AIS is in a 2-part infinite loop like when spell frames are rendering.
	@ lol next AIS frame is already in r0.

		@ Well it is a 2-part infinite loop. Let's see if it's done rendering yet.

		lsr r2, #0x10 @ Shift 0x00190000 2 bytes to get 0x19.

			@ Looks like it's not done rendering yet... FINE BE THAT WAY.
