INFO=By default, flag 0x80, field 1 forces long-range distance in addition to disabling countering from either side.  This patch splits that ability into its own ability in field 4.  In field 4, the flags are: 01 - melee (disabled due to softlocking from range) ; 02 - ranged ; 04 - long-distance ; 08 - solo(such as during use of Fortify) ; 10 - promotions .  All possible options are included in case someone has use for them, but the main ones to use are flags 02 and 04.
